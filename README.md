The entire process has been divided into the following steps :

1. Import libraries and datasets

3. Plot the word cloud
4. Perform data cleaning and create a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization
5. Train a Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression and Gradient Booster model
6. Assess trained model performance

Each of the above mentioned steps have been implemented sequentially in the jupyter notebook.
